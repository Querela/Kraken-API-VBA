# Examples

Contains example Excel file(s) using Macros (`*.xslm`) to demonstrate how to use the **Kraken.com API** VBA modules.

Currently, the [public API](https://www.kraken.com/features/api#public-market-data) is completely covered.  
I have exported each sheet modul for easier viewing,
but they are *bound* to the Excel file/structure because of how the input and output is being realised.
