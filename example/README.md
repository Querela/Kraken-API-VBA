# Examples

Contains example Excel file(s) using Macros (`*.xslm`) to demonstrate how to use the **Kraken.com API** VBA modules.

Currently, the [public API](https://www.kraken.com/features/api#public-market-data) is completely covered.  
I have exported each sheet modul for easier viewing,
but they are *bound* to the Excel file/structure because of how the input and output is being realised.

The Excel file works as it is (!) and the modules can be used for exploring the code or importing in other Excel files.
(_Probably more likely to import the generic API and Utils modules than the Sheet event handler modules (`Tabelle1-9`) ..._)
